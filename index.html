            <p>- I was really scared about the abseiling but the instructor Mike was really encouraging,
                and helped me do it, thanks Mike

            <p>- The Scouts loved every second of it, especially the powerboating,

                Scout Leader</p>
            <p>- The archery was brilliant, but not as good as axe throwing.
                I never thought we would be allowed to do that! I got one of my axes right in the middle of the target.
